the dual editor library can converts an html text area into a very simple
real-time wysiwyg html editor. The text area width is divided by half and
an html view of the markup entered into the text area is displayed to the
right.

Installation:
1) Copy dual_editor.js to your web server
2) reference dual_editor.js in your web page
3) Add a text area to your page and set it's class to "dual_editor"

on the page load event dual_editor.js will find the text area who's
class is "dual_editor" and turn it into a dual editor.

NOTE: This has been tested on Firefox and Google Chrome. It should work
on Safari and other webkit browsers too. It has not been tested on any
version of IE, and due its to the differences in event handling it
probably will not work. FORK ME! and add IE support if you want it.
